## 📚 Project Overview

This project focuses on applying **semantic segmentation** to **multispectral remote sensing images** using **deep learning techniques with PyTorch**.

Multispectral images contain information beyond the visible RGB spectrum, capturing additional bands that provide more accurate insight into the characteristics of observed objects.  
In this work, several **deep neural network architectures**—originally designed for RGB inputs—have been successfully adapted to handle these more complex multispectral formats.

After evaluating multiple architectures, we found that **lighter models**, such as `ResNet18dilated + C1 deepsup`, not only offer better computational efficiency but also achieve **competitive accuracy** of **87.74%** in semantic segmentation.  
These results confirm that, with proper adaptation, existing RGB-based models can be effectively reused in the multispectral domain—sometimes even outperforming heavier alternatives like `ResNet101`.
